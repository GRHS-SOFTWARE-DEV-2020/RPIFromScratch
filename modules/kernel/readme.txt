bcm2708 is the core architecture of the BCM2835. This builds "kernel.img"
	RPI 1 series, Compute Module 1, RPI Zero series

bcm2709 is the core architecture of the BCM2836. This builds "kernel6.img"
	RPI 2B

bcm2710 is the core architecture of the BCM2837. This builds "kernel7.img" and a 64 bit version "kernel8.img"
	RPI 2B v1.2, RPI 3 series, Compute Module 3 (all varieties)

bcm2711 is both the core architecture and SoC. This can use the kernel7.img or (64 bit) "kernel8.img" from elsewhere
	RPI 4
