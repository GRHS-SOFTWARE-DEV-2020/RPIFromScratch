IMPORTANT: I am still in highschool and have only a slight clue about how real-world system programming is actually preformed and structured. Take what my words and work with a grain of salt. I don't want to just lookup the answers to the problems I face and prefer to solve it myself. Critism / Feedback is OK just keep in mind my stuff will likely be A. tragic and B. nonsense to somebody use to this type of project. Thanks!
